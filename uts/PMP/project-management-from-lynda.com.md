## Getting to Know Project Management

**Components of Project Management**

- _Project_: A project is a temporary endeavor hat has a specific and unique goal, and usually a budget.
  - A project is temporary i.e it has a definite beginning and end. If the project seems to go forever, we haven't clearly defined what we're trying to accomplish.
  - A project produces a unique result i.e each project is unique.
  - Most project has budget. Money, time and resources.
- _Project Management_: Applying our knowledge and skills using various tools and techniques to achieve out project's objectives.
  - What problem are we solving? What the project is supposed to accomplish. "You gotta be very careful if you don't know where you're going, because you might not get there." - Yogi Berra.
  - How are we going to solve this problem? Choose from several possible strategy. Once choosen, flesh out the solution by gathering requirements, identifing deliverables, defining project scope and so on.
  - What's our plan for getting the project done? We need a plan for getting the project done. Details about work to be done, time taken, resources needed and much budget.
  - How will we know when we're done? Clearly defined objectives and requirements help answer this question but we need to define success criteria. Quantifiable, measurable results that show the project is complete. Like a certificate of occupancy for construction, or a project released to market.
  - How well did the project go? What worked well? What didn't work? Why? How could we have done better?
- _Project Manager_:
  - Project manager learns technical skills specific to project management, like what goes into a project plan, how to build and fine-tuned a project schedule, and how to measure performance.
  - As a project manager, its upto him that make sure the project delivers value.
  - Problem solving is the huge part of being a Project Manager.
  - Our job is to figure out how to achieve project objectives and meet the schedule and budget despite the problems that arise.
  - Interpersonal skills: to work with everyone to get the project done and done well.
  - Leadership: Insipe people, guide them , motivate them and hold them accountable.

**Project Life Cycle** : Project Management can be classified into five groups of processes.
![Five Process Group](../images/project-cycle.png)

1. Initiating: This is all about getting the project commitment to start a project.

   - Define the project.
   - Develop the initial scope.
   - Estimate the cost.
   - Plan resources.
   - Identify project stakeholders.

2. Planning: This is where we figure out the project. When the plan is complete, its time to launch the project.

   - What are we going to do?
   - How are we going to do it?
   - How will we know when we're done?

3. Executing: There is where launch of the project happens.

   - Launch the project.
   - Acquire project team.
   - Develop and manage project team.
   - Explain project guidelines.
   - Executes the plan.

4. Monitoring and Controlling: Whether the project is going according to plan, and if it isn't, we work out ways to get it back on track.

   - Report performance.
   - Control schedule.

5. Closing: Here, we get the client to officially accept that the project is complete.

   - Ensure project acceptance.
   - Document performance.
   - Gather lessons learned.
   - Close contracts.
   - Release resources.

**Traditional vs. iterative project management** :

| Traditional Project Management                                                                                                                         | Iterative Project Management                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| When each above process group occurs one after another, it's known as traditional project management                                                   | Iterative and Agile Project Management go through iterations to deliver partial yet production quality solutions at regular intervals.                                                                                                                                 |
| It works well when the project goal and solution are clearly defined and scope and deliverables are clear cut.                                         | We don't know what the solution looks like, so we have to figure it out as we go.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| The more we know about the project, the better the Waterfall appraoch works. Candidates: Simple, Low risk, familiar technology, experienced resources. | In Iterative, we need increased customer involvement, small independent teams. We then develop detailed plans for each iteration, execution becomes easier because we work on one iteration at a time, moreover, we also monitor and control the project more closely. |

**Organizational structure** has a big influence on how projects are performed, how much a project manager can do, and how easy it is to make projects successful. From the classic functional hierarchy, in which each person reports to only one supervisor, to a matrix, which is part hierarchical and part project-oriented, to a projectized organization, where most of the people work on projects. Each of these structures affects how projects are performed.

- In functional hiearachy, projects are not priority, making it difficult to achieve project success. A functional manager is typically in charge of things like the project budget. Resources are hard to come by.
- Matrix organizations are still functional hierarchies, but they support projects more than pure hierarchies do. In a matrix, project managers have some authority to make decisions. Resources assigned to projects report to two managers, their functional manager and the project manager.
- Projectized organizations are all about projects, making it much easier for project managers to produce results. Project managers have almost complete authority over their projects, including the budget. Resources are dedicated to project work and report to the project manager for the project they're assigned to.

**Organizational culture** is a set of shared values, beliefs, assumptions, habits, language, and other factors that guide people's behaviors and decisions within an organization. All those factors of organizational culture influence how projects are performed and their success.

- The organization's mission and vision shape the organization's culture. Projects that support the company mission are likely to get more attention and resources.
- Leadership and authority are also a big part of organizational culture. If management defines clear goals and then delegates responsibility to employees, that approach works equally well in your projects.
- Another aspect of culture is the organization's work environment. For example, with a positive environment, people are motivated to get things done. And gathering lessons learned is easy because employees are used to providing input and striving to improve.
- Some cultures believe in following the rules. Other cultures nurture innovation, expecting employees to try new approaches, question what's been done before, and come up with better methods. Does your organization put results ahead of procedures? That is, is it better to follow the rules even if you don't achieve the objective? Or can you do whatever it takes as long as you deliver the desired results?
- Change management can be affected by the organization's culture. If the organization is risk averse, the change management process might include multiple rounds of review and require approval from several people. On the other hand, if change is viewed simply as life in the project management world, the change management process is probably a lot simpler.
- In projects with people working in locations around the country or the world, you also need to consider the cultures of your team members.

## Exploring PM Knowledge Areas

**Manage project scope**: Project Scope describes the boundaries of a project(included and not included in project). Scope management is manage what is, and is not, included in the project

1. Scope Management Plan: outlines the processes for defining, validating and controlling scope.
2. Collect Requirements: identifying and documenting project requirements needed to achieve the project objectives.
3. Define Scope: weed out requirements that aren't absolutely necessary. Prepare a _Project Scope_ statement to document what is and isn't included in scope. The project team has to work to deliver the project scope. We create a Work Breakdown Structure, to show our project divided into progressively smaller pieces.
4. Control Scope: Scope has a tendency to expand if you aren't careful, which is why controlling scope is an important part of Scope Management. To prevent Scope Creep, we have to monitor project status and manage change requests.
5. Validate Scope: review completed deliverables to make sure they've been completed satisfactorily.
